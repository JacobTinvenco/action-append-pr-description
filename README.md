    with:
      auth: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      repo: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
      owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
      pr: ${{ github.event.number }}
      text: "https://my-url.test"
```

## Inputs

- `auth` - (required) A [GitHub Secret Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow) with access to the repository you want to update.

- `repo` - (required) The GitHub repository name containing the PR to update.

- `owner` - (required) The GitHub repository owner.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

You can test the action locally by copying the code to your own repo (that uses a github workflow).

When updating the code, don't forget to run `yarn package` and commit the `dist/index.js` file since this is the one used by the action.
